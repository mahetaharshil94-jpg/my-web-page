    <p>त्वमेव माता च पिता त्वमेव, त्वमेव बंधुश्च सखा त्वमेव ।
त्वमेव विद्या, द्रविम् त्वमेव, त्वमेव सर्वं मम देव देव ।।
Thou art Mother, thou art Father, thou art kinsman, thou art friend,
thou art knowledge, thou art wealth; thou art my all, O'Lord of Lords.
'Srimad Bhagavad Gita' is just not a holy book, it has alsc
gained a prominent place in literature of the world. It contains
divine words emanatingfrom the lips ofLord Krishna. This great
epic is an eloquent proof of the observation. As a scripture, this
Book embodies the supreme spiritual mystery and secrets. Its
style is so simple and elegant that with a little study one can
easily follow the structure of its words, yet the thoughts behind
those words are so deep and abstruse that even for life time,
constant study of this Book may not show an end of it.
